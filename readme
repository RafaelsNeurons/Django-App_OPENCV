This Project was created to stream a USB-Camera with OpenCV in a Web-Application.
I used a Windows-PC and Visual Studio Code to create this Project.

The streaming part of this project was by this tutorial:

I changed the project structure, but the tutorial was a good start to learn something about how to stream a camera in django.
